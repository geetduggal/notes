# Current  setup

WIP doc

## Note-taking

Goals:

* Simple
* Future proof
* Flexible
* Searchable
* Mobile and Desktop friendly

Components:

* Dropbox
* Typora
* 1Writer
* Github

Methodology:

* Everything is a sorted list of files with little to no nested directory structure\(date modified\)
* File names act as tags for filtering
* TODO list and journal in one Markdown file \(thinking about benefits/drawbacks of splitting this up into multiple files\)
* Github repos also included in directory with files
* Dropbox is the cloud medium for the files.
* Typora is used on the Desktop for editing Markdown files
* 1Writer is used on iOS for editing Markdown
* Rely on OS and Dropbox for search

Examples/scenarios of usage:

* Dropbox's app is very handy for scanning documents and uploading photos. Super helpful for naming files in bulk as well.
* Typora is particularly useful for copy-pasting images and other content in Markdown-friendly way.   Image files can be copied automatically with relative paths so that the whole setup is self-contained.

Issues/room for improvement

## Transportation

I currently own a 2015 Nissan Leaf SV as an experiment to ride electric since most of my transportation is local. We have a 2015 Subaru Impreza in the family for longer trips.

For local transportation, I have an Imax S1+ which is better suited for longer distances and is a smoother, faster ride \(but considerably heavier than my previous Uscooter\).

## Gadgets

* Macbook Pro 13'': Go-to for getting anything productive done at home.
* iPhone XS Max + Apple Watch: phone of choice, but Pixel 3 XL is tempting.  I really like to use the Apple Watch to control music while walking the dog, e.g.  I thankfully also tend to not miss calls or important notifications.  I am therefore very selective about notifications interrupting me, though.
* iPad Pro 10.5'': Mostly for watching videos, thinking about whether I really need this.
* Kindle Oasis: Go to for longer reading sessions including articles or books.
* Ember smart mug: I'm a slow tea / espresso drinker or sometimes get distracted. Love that it is still warm when I want it.
* Bose QC30 and QC35: Love both of these to provide

## Home

* Google Home: 3 homes and 2 home hubs to be scattered throughout our condo for controlling lights, music, and providing useful info when desired.
* Google Wifi
* Instant Pot: I love this thing for cooking
